## **Abstract**

Smart environments often suffer from a lack of transparency, leaving visitors feeling watched rather than served. To address this, we developed "Mind the Sensors," an interactive system that allows users to easily grant or deny data collection consent via natural modalities like voice, camera, and web interfaces. Our approach utilizes a Raspberry Pi-based embedded platform running local facial and voice recognition pipelines to ensure privacy. Key results demonstrate high user trust (4.5/5 average) and ease of use across scenarios, with keyword spotting achieving near 100% accuracy. This project provides building owners and developers with reusable patterns to deploy privacy-respecting smart spaces.
